# This is a gross index.md file

I have to create this for the assignment.

Back in high school I created this GitHub repository for another assignment so I already have a ***severely outdated but style somewhate relevant [real index page]***(https://coltonhix.github.io/index-old). As far as I can remember the page utilizies Bootstrap and contains custom (but very, VERY old) CSS, JavaScript (I think) and HTML.
