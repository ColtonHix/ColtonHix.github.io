# This is a gross index.md file

I have to create this for the assignment.

Back in high school I created this GitHub repository for another assignment so I already have a severely outdated but still somewhat relevant [index page](https://coltonhix.github.io/index-old). As far as I can remember the page utilizies Bootstrap and contains custom but very old (and messy) CSS, JavaScript (I think) and HTML.

### Reasons I don't use markdown
* I use CSS
* I lied, I have to for this assignment

### Look it's my handmade logo and favicon from years ago that I accidentally made into low quality
![Really not sure a .ico will show up here](https://coltonhix.github.io/favicon.ico)

You know I'm pretty dissapointed I can't replicate target="\_blank" and images shove the text into an alt tag instead of a title. The latter is actually web accessibility violation...
